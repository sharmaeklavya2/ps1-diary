I changed aadharid to a CharField from an IntegerField (database type: int to varchar).
I also put a RegexValidator on the field to validate it only when it is made up of 12 numeric digits.
So now we have the same formatting advantage that integer field gives us.
And we can now also search by aadharid in the admin page (we cannot search on IntegerField, but we can on CharField).
This will be very beneficial because staff will mostly be searching for volunteers by Aadhar ID.

It took me very long to find documentation about RegexValidators. Previously I didn't even know about validators.
After searching a lot on StackOverflow, I found about validators. I read about them in the documentation.
Then I had to go through the list of all validators, trying to figure out which one of them is appropriate.
After going through the list, it was almost obvious to use a RegexValidator.
I then read about how to apply the validator.
I tried to find out whether to use a regex or a non-unicode regex (for python2 compatibility),
but it turned out that that didn't matter. Both work well.
