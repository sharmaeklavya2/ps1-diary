We modified the models.py file and the admin.py file to fine-tune the admin display.
We added more descriptive help fields to models.py.
We added and removed fields from list display, list filters and search fields.

We also wanted to reduce the space occupied by the inline Registration fields.
After a lot of searching, we found out that we had to use
TabularInline instead of StackedInline to achieve that.
