Today Quiz 2 was held.  The questions were tested whether we were aware what all work other groups in Red Cross are doing.
I didn't exactly know about one or two groups.

Even though we had set up a CI server, there wasn't much that we were testing.
We were just testing whether our settings were valid or not.
This is clearly not enough.
But since we had not written any application logic, we could only include linters and static type checkers right now.

We added pyflakes as a linter and code checker.
However, pyflakes is not very good at either (jack of both, master of none).
So for linting we added a custom linter.
I copied and modified some code for that from Zulip
(a famous open-source django web application, https://zulip.org), where I am a contributor.

We added mypy as a static type checker. To use mypy, we'll have to type annotate our code.
I am familiar with mypy and mypy annotation is easy to learn.
So I'll help my friends if they face problems in adding annotations.
We'll stop annotating code if that gives problems.
