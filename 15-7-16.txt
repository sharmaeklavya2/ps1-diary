I finally figured out how to add objects into database.
I will do a bulk_create and check if an IntegrityError is raised.
It doesn't matter if bulk_create operation is not atomic,
since we already have to deal with the problem of already existing objects.
On catching the IntegrityError, I'll fall back to calling save() on each object.
save does things nicely. It tries to do an update based on the primary key
and does an insert if the update fails.

I also added sample data to test out my scripts and committed that to the git repository.

I also added tests for this in Travis.

I also added my database migration to the git repository.
Previously it was not version-controlled because our schema wasn't stable.

I also reset my heroku instance and populated it remotely.
It worked.
