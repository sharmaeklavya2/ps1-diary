Today I made pincode as primary key in SubDistrict instead of the default autoincremented id.
This has the benefit that it will now be easy to add subdistrict in admin.
Previously we had to look up the id of each subdistrict.
Now we just have to enter the subdistrict's pin code.

This was difficult to implement.
I was using an autoincremented id as the surrogate key instead of using (pin, district_id) as the primary key.
This is because Django does not support using a composite primary key.
To change it, I had to override the save method.
