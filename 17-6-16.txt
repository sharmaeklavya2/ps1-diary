We had decided yesterday that we'll make our own web application.
Today we decided that we will make our application in Django.
To make a web application using Django, we write code in the Python programming language which using libraries provided by Django.

Since web development in Django requires writing code in python and since web pages are made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript,
we decided to learn these technologies.
Some of us know a small amount of python and I know python well.
Some of us, including me, know a small amount of HTML and CSS.

So today, we searched for resources from where we could learn python and HTML/CSS.
We decided to continue learning over the weekend.
Since I was the only one who knew python well enough, I decided to refresh my knowlege of django over the weekend.
