Today I wrote code to allow filtering volunteers by active/inactive.
This required me to write some good amount of ORM querying code.
Since the probability of making errors is high, I wrote automated tests for this code.
This will make sure that if someone makes wrong changes to this code, tests will catch that.
I also made these tests run on Travis CI.

I also added a custom list filter for this by subclassing SimpleListFilter.
