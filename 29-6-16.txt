Today we added list filters and search fields to our models' admin page.
This required us to read a lot of documentation.

The list filters allow us to specify things on which to
filter search results, like gender, state and institution type.
The search fields add a search box to the top of the admin page
which can be used to search for text in chosen text fields of all records.
