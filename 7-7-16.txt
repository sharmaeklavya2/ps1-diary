Today I added a list filter for volunteer type.
Now it is possible to filter volunteers as Junior, Youth and Community.
Previously it was possible to filter out junior and youth volunteers
but no way to filter out community volunteers.

I fixed this problem by making a custom list filter.
To do this I had to subclass SimpleListFilter and override appropriate methods.

I also did some cleaning up of the code.
I abstracted out aadharid's length into a separate variable called AADHAR_LENGTH.
I improved the representation of Districts and SubDistricts in the admin page.
I also added dummy id fields to all models to help mypy with type checking.
