Today we had to present our project in a meeting to the people at Red Cross.
Before the meeting began, we gave final touches to our powerpoint presentation and decided who will speak what.
During the meeting, all groups presented their projects.
Most of them had completed their work and they had done a good job according to me.

Snimar had designed a very good website for Red Cross.
He had also put a provision for them to add/edit/remove content without relying on the web master.
Yet, it was somewhat critisized by the people at Red Cross.
I didn't like that.  Red Cross people didn't know how much effort went behind it.
I did because I am somewhat experienced in web development.
They mostly critisized him for content, not realizing that it was their duty to change the content,
which Snimar had made a provision for.
We are here for writing code and we shouldn't be expected to do anything apart from that.
We are engineers, not writers.

My presentation went well. They were happy with what I had done.
We will now meet again on Friday. I was told to add many more things.
I don't know if I'll be able to do that, since I have just a week left.
They want this project to be up. I'll try and do that.
