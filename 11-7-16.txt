Some code cleanup was required. This also included some suggestions by Joint Secretary in the presentation.
Add id to list_display of School and SubDistrict.
Use 'School' and 'College' as type of school instead of using 'Junior' and 'Youth'.
Also change volunteer type from 'J', 'Y', 'C' to 'Junior', 'Youth', 'Community'.
Also set School's verbose name to 'School/College'.
This commit will invalidate existing data. Fortunately it's easy to correct that from the admin interface.
