# PS1 diary

This is the PS1 diary which BITS Pilani forces us to write.
This diary is supposed to be a log of our daily activities in our PS stations.
BITS Pilani forces us to write on a paper diary, which is awful.
Since I type fast compared to writing with a pen, I type my diary before writing it.

## About the project
