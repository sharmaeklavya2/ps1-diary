Today a group discussion was held at 10:30 pm. The topic of the group discussion was 'Current trends in Computer-based education'.
Everyone discussed about trends in Computer-based education from primary schools up to college.
We talked about how computer-based education started, how it gained popularity and how it is advancing right now.
People primarily spoke about role of computer-based education in college students' life,
probably because they have first-hand experience in this subject.

I talked about how computers help people connect and how this is useful for students to get projects.
Professors in a student's university might not be interested in giving him a project because
either they have already taken students or because they are not interested in the subject.
However, there are various online programs where people can find experienced mentors and professors
under which they can do a project, like Google Summer of Code, programs conducted by various universities, etc.

After the discussion was over, me and my team mates looked at how much progress we have made with our project
and what all needs to be accomplished.
