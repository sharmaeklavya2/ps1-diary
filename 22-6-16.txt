Today we finally started writing code for our django application.
We decided the settings for our django project.
That turned out to be difficult since the settings should be written in such a way that
they run both on our computers and on Heroku's servers.

Our computers and Heroku's servers are configured very differently.
Our computer hosts code insecurely on our network interfaces, Heroku hosts code behind a secure reverse-proxy.
We want to use SQLite as our database backend while Heroku uses PosgtreSQL.
Because of that it took us a lot of time to set up.

Important software should always be thoroughly tested using automated testing.
So we decided to do that for our code. That will help reduce regression bugs.
We decided to use a Continous Integration (CI) server for automated testing.
We chose Travis CI, since that is free for open source projects (like ours).
we read documentation and learned how to do that.
I added a .travis.yml file to our repository.
