Yesterday we had read about and set up linters and code checkers to use on our code.
Today we had to write scripts to use these linters and checkers on appropriate files and give out appropriate exit codes.
We then added commands in .travis.yml so that these scripts would be run on our CI server.
We had to again see Travis documentation to do that.

After that we wrote code for our models.
While writing some code, we realized that our database schema was not appropriate and we decided to modify it.
It started becoming more complex and we were afraid of going forward with the modifications.
So we discussed a lot about possible use cases. We decided to go ahead with the schema modifications.
I finished writing the basic stuff for the models.
