Since all of us don't know django, it would be difficult for others to know what is going on in the project.
Those who are focussing on python will still be able to understand something in the django code,
but those who are focussing on HTML, CSS will not be able to understand anything.
Running django code on one's own computer is difficult for those who don't know django.
So we decided to deploy our code on a cloud so that everyone in our group can view it.
We chose Heroku for this.

Today I spent the day learning how to deploy a web application on Heroku.
I had already developed some django applications before joining PS1 and I practiced by deploying them.
