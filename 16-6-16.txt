We are still struggling with setting up Sahana Eden. We thought using a Docker would be easy but it's not.
So we gave up after some time and instead decided to set it up on a server on the cloud.
I have a digitalocean account, so I rented a server.
It didn't cost me money because I have a free credits from my Github student pack.
I hosted an Ubuntu server and tried to set up Sahana on it using the Apache/MySQL instructions.

That didn't go well. The script used to fail at various points.
Some of the packages Sahana Eden was using were upgraded and it was no longer compatible with those packages.
Upon further investigation, I realized that Sahana Eden is not a well maintained project and is slowly suffering software rot.
Therefore we gave up on using Sahana Eden and decided to build our own web application.
