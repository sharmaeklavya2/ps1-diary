Today I started work on a script to load location data from CSV files.
There will be a CSV file for states which will include the state code and State name.
There will be a CSV file for districts which will include district pin, state code and district name.
There will be a CSV file for subdistricts which will include pincode and subdistrict name.

The script will be helpful because we won't have to add states again and again with every database reset in development.
This will also make things quicker in production.

I added code to read CSV files. I'm yet to see how to put this code inside a database.
I tried to see bulk_create operation but that will give problems if objects already exist in database.
